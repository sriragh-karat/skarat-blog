description: An introduction to my blog and what I'll be writing about
---

## Welcome to skarat.dev

This is my first post on my new tech blog! I'm excited to start documenting my journey in embedded systems, ARM architecture, and low-level programming.

### What I'll Be Writing About

I plan to cover topics including:

- **Embedded Systems Development**: From bare-metal programming to RTOS concepts
- **ARM Architecture**: Deep dives into ARM processors and optimization techniques
- **Networking**: Protocol implementations and network stack debugging
- **Power Management**: Power-efficient design patterns and optimization strategies

### Why This Blog?

Technical writing is a skill I want to improve, and there's no better way to learn than by teaching.
